Inspiration from the original CCDC competition utility created by @wumb0 (https://github.com/wumb0)  
  
- Removed non Python Standard Library import  
- Added print function to display PE compile time without making any modifications  
- Added ability to set specific date/time using human-readable format  
- Added additional logic to more "sane" random timestamp setting functionality
